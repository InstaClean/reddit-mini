## Overview

This app allows works mainly through the use of the undocumented reddit JSON API. Simply put, a user can get data from any reddit page in JSON format by appending any reddit URL with ".json". 

-- For Example: [r/pics in JSON format](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics.json)

Using a Redux Async Thunk as middleware, we can get the data from the subreddit and have posts presented to the user.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I took the time to step outside my comfort zone and create this project with React.js. I have made other projects with react but I am proud to say I created this all from my own work and/or research.


### Continued development

If I were ever to revisit this project, I would add responsiveness for other devices and tablets.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-app-to-github-pages/) - This site helped me learn how to properly deploy a React application from my terminal.
